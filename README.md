# Modeling and Control of a Mechanical System

This project focuses on the **modeling, analysis, and control design** of a DC motorâ€“driven mechanical system.  
It includes mathematical modeling, system identification, and digital controller implementation to achieve a specified equilibrium position under dynamic and steady-state design constraints.

## ðŸ“˜ Contents
- Continuous- and discrete-time modeling
- Controller design (PI, Deadbeat, Dahlin)
- Feedforward and Anti-Windup integration
- Parameter estimation via Least Squares
- Simulation and validation
